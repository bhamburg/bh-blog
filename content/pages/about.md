I’m a web developer with the [DICE Group at Jefferson](https://dicegrp.org), where I get to work with a talented and diverse team of technologists, designers, researchers, and writers to improve healthcare and education experiences across the greater Philadelphia region and beyond.

When I’m not wrangling websites or strumming the old four-string, my other hobbies include reading about tech and philosophy, rooting for the Phillies and Eagles, and playing and collecting classic and modern video games on my various original consoles and custom-built gaming PC.
