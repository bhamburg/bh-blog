I’m a web developer with the [DICE Group at Jefferson](https://dicegrp.org), where I get to work with a talented and diverse team of technologists, designers, researchers, and writers to improve healthcare and education experiences across the greater Philadelphia region and beyond.

## Strumming and Mumming

It all started when my father asked me to join the newly formed Irish American String Band, to take tenor banjo lessons with him, and to participate in the Philadelphia Mummers Parade for the year 2000. More than twenty years later, the banjo has taken me places that I never thought possible.

My main instrument is now the four-string plectrum banjo, which I play as a member of the Fralinger String Band and several traditional jazz and Dixieland bands when the opportunities arise. With the Fralinger band, we’ve literally traveled around the world, performing in myriad parades and festivals including the International Chinese New Year Parade in Hong Kong and the Mardi Gras parades in New Orleans.

As a member of Fralinger since April of 2001, I was fortunate enough to be a part of our record-setting, eight-consecutive Mummers Parade championships. It's an honor to perform with such talented musicians and represent the United States and the City of Philadelphia while entertaining people with this traditional American instrument.</p>

## Et Cetera

When I’m not wrangling websites or strumming the old four-string, my other hobbies include reading about tech and philosophy, rooting for the Phillies and Eagles, and playing and collecting classic and modern video games on my various original consoles and custom-built gaming PC.

I’ve become a bit of a retro gaming connoisseur over the past few years while rebuilding my library of cartridges and enjoying them in the highest fidelity possible. My tastes gravitate towards games from and inspired by the 8- and 16-bit “golden age” of pixel art. Kids can keep their Fortnite and Overwatch. Give me the “NES Hard” platformers, run-and-guns, and RPGs. If anyone wants to chat about PVM CRT scan lines in 240p RGB, 1CHIP SNES models, or the latest advances in FPGA-based systems with near-perfect accuracy and zero-to-low input latency, hit me up.
