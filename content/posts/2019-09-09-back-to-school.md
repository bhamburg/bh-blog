  Forgive me, reader. It has been nearly a decade since my last blog post. Today
  represents a day of new beginnings for several important reasons. The most
  important of all is that my twin daughters start their first day of preschool
  today. They have formally begun their lifelong process of learning. I’m so
  excited for them and the new experiences they’re going to have and the friends
  they will meet along the way. I’ll admit, I’m understandably a bit nervous as
  well.

Forgive me, reader. It has been nearly a decade since my last blog post. Today represents a day of new beginnings for several important reasons. The most important of all is that my twin daughters start their first day of preschool today. They have formally begun their lifelong process of learning. I’m so excited for them and the new experiences they’re going to have and the friends they will meet along the way. I’ll admit, I’m understandably a bit nervous as well.

As anyone in my immediate family can tell you, I’ve had a love/hate relationship with school over the years. The best way I can briefly describe my own scholastic achievement is that of someone with great potential who is easily distracted. The same could be said for my career in web development and even music. On the one hand, I know my girls will be just fine since they have such a strong family support system in place, but on the other hand it’s absolutely terrifying watching my babies enter a world with so many threats and temptations. Yeah, I know they’re only 3-and-a-half, but time certainly isn’t slowing down.

## Turning The Page

With those considerations in mind, I’m using this as a jumping off point to hopefully restore my own focus and attention to lifelong learning and creative endeavors. Maybe it’s been the lack of sleep that comes from being a new parent. Maybe it’s the onslaught of great video games that particularly tap into my nostalgia for simpler times, binge-worthy TV shows on Netflix, and social media that’s harder than ever to look away from. Maybe it’s all of the above, but one thing I know for sure is that I haven’t been focusing closely enough on improving myself in my technical vocation or my musical avocation and I wish to remedy that.

That’s not to say I’m just posting a confessional today. I believe fatherhood has had a dramatic net positive effect on me. I would do anything for my girls. They are top of mind in every decision I make, my A-Number-One priority no matter how stressful it can be at times. My wife is my rock and inspiration everyday, and the girls are so lucky to have such an attentive and caring mother. She’s a constant reminder that I need to keep my head on straight because they deserve my best. In addition, there are a number of books I’ve read to cope with the chaos and to more stoically approach obstacles. I’ve also recently dropped a good amount of weight and picked up running as my main source of exercise. Gotta keep the numbers on that new smart scale we just got moving in the right direction, especially since I’m not getting any younger.

Career-wise, I’m in a really good spot right now. They say the best time to look for a new job is when you already have one, but I haven’t had a compelling reason to leave Jefferson in seven years and I find the work we do at DICE to be rewarding. However, I’ve also read “Who Moved My Cheese?” and I’m well-aware of the pitfalls of stagnation. After all, the “I” stands for “innovation” and there is constant pressure to deliver on that promise.

## What Do I Have To Say?



## Going Forward

I want this to be a place where I can arrange my thoughts cohesively as both a benefit to myself and a benefit to anyone who finds what I have to say useful. As a former colleague once said, it’s good for “one’s own edification” to list accomplishments and discuss what we learn along the way. I want this blog to be a reflection of my own intrinsic motivation to improve my skills in the various fields of study that I find interesting and to advocate for those interests. At the very least, my intention here is to set a good example for my daughters to use our limited time here on this planet constructively.

I hope that you will join me here regularly.
